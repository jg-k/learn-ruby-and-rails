# Learn Ruby and Rails
This page is inspired from Felipe Vogel's fantastic [Ruby resource list](https://github.com/fpsvogel/learn-ruby?).  
Felips's list is extremely rich and contains most of the resources listed here, so I would encourage you to go straight to Felipe s page if you are looking for a well researched and extensive Web development / Ruby / Rails / Front end resource list that will get you from to 0 to 99.  

This list serves primarily as a record for myself of the learning material I have been through and the resources I personnally have found most valuable. I include a brief comment on each item, just the opinion of the moment, nothing absolute. 
It also does not include formats that do not work well for me, such as videos and podcasts

It could still be of interest if you are at the beginning of your journey and Felipe's list is too daunting.

## Books
### Programming
- [Programming Ruby 3.3](https://pragprog.com/titles/ruby5/programming-ruby-3-3-5th-edition/) by Noel Rappin  
Aka the pickaxe. A classic on the Ruby language, well worth getting have a weighty physical copy.
- [Metaprogramming Ruby](https://pragprog.com/titles/ppmetr2/metaprogramming-ruby-2/) by Pablo Perrota  
A great read that takes you beyond beginner level, demistifying a lot of concepts that are beyond ruby basics. I would not advise reading this too early in the learning journey as it would only overload your mental model and not much would stick. But once comfortable with the basics, it is the key that will let you dare to start opening existing gems and third party libraries. 
Not the newest book around, but that doesn't matter much for the purpose.
- [Practical Object-Oriented Design, An Agile Primer Using Ruby (POODR)](https://www.poodr.com/) by Sandi Metz  
Highly recommended reading this early on in your journey, to get a grasp on essential Object Oriented programming principles. Then get some practice before having another (quicker) read. I occasionally come back to it and while I still finding useful parts, i appreciate getting a bit less out of it as you slowly internalise the main concepts over time.
- [High Performance Browser Networking](https://hpbn.co/) by Ilya Grigorik  
Excellent general foundation knowledge on networking, transport protocols, HTTP versions, Browser APIs etc. Parts of it a bit dated but well worth a read. Great to read while commuting, as you don t need a ruby console nearby. Some bits can be skimmed through.
- [Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) by Martin Fowler  
I mention it here because it is a classic, but I personally struggle to get much out of it. It s not a page turner, and contains a catalogue of techniques that is not easy to assimilate. Maybe better luck in the future.
- [A Commonâ€“Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Common-Sense-Guide-Data-Structures-Algorithms/dp/1680507222) by Jen Wengrow  
I was going through the Odin ruby chapters and took a break to go through this book. I d recommend it if you ve never had computer science courses, as it s very much "algorithm  for dummies". Great to get just enough algorithm culture for all these code katas (sorting, linked lists, b trees etc). Covers most of the classics and stops when things get complex, so I intend to follow up with a next level book on the topic at a later stage, yet it s totally sufficient to get rid of beginner/latecomer fear of the topic. Easy read.

### Process & mindset
- [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) by Ryan Singer    
37 signals process for running projects. Compelling read. I was lucky to get the chance to start following the Shape Up process in my team using Basecamp.  
While promising, it was axed before we got to really give it a good shot. It has nevertheless been my most enjoyable project management environment. One reason it may not suit all teams or everybody is that it demands a fairly high level of engagement from contributors in terms of reporting.  
One topic that resionated with me is that it rejects the "sprints" and "backlog" terminology from Scrum processes. While it may be sound like pure terminology choice, "backlog" of tasks gets you run down from the never ending churn, and sprints gets you tired if you try to keep up, or feel like a slacker if you re not constantly sprinting along. 
Shape Up provides the right level in terms of project scoping, wide individual responsibility to adjust the scope and define the end result within a frame.  
It is also an enjoyable and concise read. 
- [User story mapping](https://www.amazon.co.uk/User-Story-Mapping-Discover-Product/dp/1491904909) by Jeff Paton  
I ended up reading this book to get a better grasp on how to define requirements for a software projects. 
I learnt a lot from the book, what is User Story Mapping and some interesting case studies rom various organizations. But in hindsight, the main technique described in the book doesn t feel very attractive as a design process, and if I were to run a large software project, I'd be more inclined to follow Shape Up than spend days in workshops covering walls with post its.
- [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lean-Startup-Innovation-Successful-Businesses/dp/0670921602) by Eric Ries  
A mega classic for anybody interested in startups.


## Blogs
There are countless blog on Ruby and Rails that one comes accross when learning to code or researching a topic. I only list here a few I find excellent and to which i thought it worth subscribing to the newletter. 

- [Write software well](https://www.writesoftwarewell.com/)  
Extremely well written. Hits the right spot in terms of depth of content. Does not make much assumption on the reader prior knowledge even for more advanced topic, which is always a plus in my view.  
- [Zverok on Lucid code](https://zverok.substack.com/)  
Fascinating deep dives on Ruby syntax. A great newletter to subscribe too, email are few and far between, but well worth a read, even if superficial, mostly for the fun of following the authors deep meandering into the history and evolution of the language.
- [Josh W Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/)  
Great interactive reference for Grids and Flexbox (and probably more now)

## Newsletters
There are many more, yet I don't even manage to consistently read these. These 2 are excellent and complement each other well.
- [Ruby weekly](https://rubyweekly.com/) 
Classic.
- [Short ruby](https://newsletter.shortruby.com/) by Lucian Ghinda  
Lucian includes relevant social media posts, which allows you to stay up to speed with discussion topics in the community and save you some time spent on X and co.


## Courses
- [The Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundation & Rails track  
Undoubtedly your best friend if you are getting into web development after a career change. Free, in depth and itself a collection of high quality content, either written directly for The Odin Project, or referring to other resources.
The mix of own material and extensive references to a wide range of resources of all kinds is one of the strongest point as it very much reflects how one goes about learning about any topics later on and lets you figure out which ones work best for you (I figured out video content is not my thing!).  
It is a very long course which you can follow at your pace. When starting, I was obsessed with how fast or slow I should go or others would go. It s hard, but the quicker you let go of these concerns, the better because there really is no valid answer. Depending on your prior knowledge, your experience, your available time for learning, the depth you wish to get into a topic, the time spent on the course can vary infinitely, and I believe the most important is to just keep going, no matter how slow you feel you are going. 
- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/)  
Another fantastic resource. Large number of coding exerces in any language under the sun. The most valuable feature for me was the review and iteration process, either with a real human developper kindly and patiently reviewing your code submiossion for free, or by stufying otheer possible solutions to a given exercise. This is excellent preparation for real world pull request review processes.  
I d advise starting with this early on, as it starts at "Hello World" and get progressively harder. It also focuses on the "basics" of a language. Feels a bit like going to the gym, perfect to get your repetitions on the basic constructs.  
With the huge number of language tracks, there s no shortage of options for further explorations.
- [The rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) $$ Not recommended.  
This is an extensive tutorial that will get you from zero knowledge to a nice looking twitter like app and aim to teach the basics in all core areas all along. The premise of the tutorial is that you will "Learn enough to be dangerous", with the idea that you will pick up the rest easily after completing it. The reality is that you are not dangerous at all, have a very shallow understanding of all the topics covered, yet you are left with the opposite impression that you can now build anything.  
If you are tempted, I d really recommend you do yourself a favor and take the slow and painful road straight away and go for something like [the Odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)  


## Official docs
-  [The rails guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/index.html)
Should likely be the first port of call for any rails related question, yet strangely for a long time, it was the last place I would look into.
